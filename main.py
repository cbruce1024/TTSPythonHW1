# x = 10
# y = 50
# if x ** 2 > 100 and y < 100:
#     print(x, y)
# There is no output- the conditions of the if statement are not met. Thus, the print statement isn't executed

# 5)
# a = [10, 20]
# b = a
# b += [30, 40]
# print(a)
# print(b)
# the += operator both adds and assigns values. It concatenates the [10, 20] list with the [30,40] list

# 6)
# print(2%6)
# The above code prints 2 in the console
# This is because the % is the modulo operator that checks for remainders.
# Thus, the remainder when 2 is divided by 6 is 2

# 7)
# print(2 * 3 ** 3 * 4)
# The output is 216
# This is because the computer is following order of operations and the exponent (**) operation is done first.
